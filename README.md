# Final Project for Machine Learning

In this project, I use a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) on heart disease. I compared the accuracy of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Bagging algoithms in Python to determine which was the most accurate. For this dataset, Decision Tree and Random Forest are the best fit.

This was completed for Machine Learning COSC-A406 at Loyola University New Orleans.
